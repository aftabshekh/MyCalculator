 Advanced Calculator
The Advanced Calculator is a web-based application designed to perform various arithmetic operations efficiently. Created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project aims to provide users with a robust and user-friendly tool for quick and accurate calculations.

Key Features:
Clear Display: The calculator features a large display area to show the current input and results clearly.

Basic Arithmetic: Supports essential operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Advanced Functions: Includes percentage calculation and deletion of the last digit.

Responsive Design: The application is designed to be fully responsive, ensuring usability across different devices and screen sizes.

Error Handling: The calculator handles errors gracefully, displaying an error message if an invalid operation is performed.

Technologies Used:
HTML: Defines the structure and layout of the calculator interface.

CSS: Adds styling and enhances the visual appearance, including responsive design for various screen sizes.

JavaScript: Implements the logic for arithmetic operations, user interactions, and error handling.

How It Works:
User Input: The calculator captures user input through button clicks. Each button is associated with a specific function, such as appending a digit or performing an operation.

Display Update: The display area dynamically updates to reflect the current input or result of an operation.

Arithmetic Operations: JavaScript functions handle the core arithmetic operations. The eval() function evaluates the input expression and computes the result.

Error Handling: If the input expression is invalid, the calculator displays an "Error" message without crashing.

Code Breakdown:
HTML: Creates the structure of the calculator, including the display area and buttons.

CSS: Styles the calculator for a modern, clean look, ensuring it remains visually appealing on different devices.

JavaScript: Implements the logic for various operations, including clearing the display, deleting the last digit, appending digits/operations to the display, and calculating the result.

Potential Enhancements:
Scientific Functions: Adding more complex mathematical functions, such as trigonometric operations, square root, and exponentiation.

Keyboard Support: Allowing users to interact with the calculator using keyboard input for enhanced accessibility.

History Log: Maintaining a log of previous calculations for reference and convenience.
